## Dependencies

### Build Environment

This project requires at least the following to build:

* A C++ compiler that conforms to the C++20 standard or greater
* CMake 3.30 or later
* (Test Only) GoogleTest

You can disable building tests by setting CMake option `BEMAN_GATES_BUILD_TESTS` to
`OFF` when configuring the project.

## Development

See the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Integrate beman.gates into your project

### Build

You can build gates using a CMake workflow preset:

```bash
cmake --workflow --preset gcc-release
```

To list available workflow presets, you can invoke:

```bash
cmake --list-presets=workflow
```

For details on building beman.gates without using a CMake preset, refer to the
[Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Installation

#### Vcpkg

The preferred way to install gates is via vcpkg. To do so, after installing vcpkg
itself, you need to add support for the Beman project's [vcpkg
registry](https://github.com/bemanproject/vcpkg-registry) by configuring a
`vcpkg-configuration.json` file (which gates [provides](vcpkg-configuration.json)).

Then, simply run `vcpkg install beman-gates`.

#### Manual

To install beman.gates globally after building with the `gcc-release` preset, you can
run:

```bash
sudo cmake --install build/gcc-release
```

Alternatively, to install to a prefix, for example `/opt/beman`, you can run:

```bash
sudo cmake --install build/gcc-release --prefix /opt/beman
```

This will generate the following directory structure:

```txt
/opt/beman
├── include
│   └── beman
│       └── gates
│           ├── gates.hpp
│           └── ...
└── lib
    └── cmake
        └── beman.gates
            ├── beman.gates-config-version.cmake
            ├── beman.gates-config.cmake
            └── beman.gates-targets.cmake
```

### CMake Configuration

If you installed beman.gates to a prefix, you can specify that prefix to your CMake
project using `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`; for example, `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/beman`.

You need to bring in the `beman.gates` package to define the `beman::gates` CMake
target:

```cmake
find_package(beman.gates REQUIRED)
```

You will then need to add `beman::gates` to the link libraries of any libraries or
executables that include `beman.gates` headers.

```cmake
target_link_libraries(yourlib PUBLIC beman::gates)
```

### Using beman.gates

To use `beman.gates` in your C++ project,
include an appropriate `beman.gates` header from your source code.

```c++
#include <beman/gates/gates.hpp>
```
